This will largely be a sandbox for new ideas

## A little about myself:
My name is Samuel Henthorne. I plan on using GitHub for developing and hosting a website where I post all of my hobby projects and all the stories I "write".
That's about all you'll get from this for now. Check [my twitter](https://twitter.com/The1AndMany) if you want more insight into my head.
